* Exercise 1.9.  
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two
positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its
argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1. 

#+begin_src scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
#+end_src

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or
recursive? 

* Answer

** Using the first procedure 
   #+begin_src scheme
   (+ 4 5)
   (inc (+ 3 5))
   (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
   (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
   (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
   (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
   9  
   #+end_src

** Using the second procedure
   #+begin_src scheme
   (+ 4 5)
   (+ 3 6)
   (+ 2 7)
   (+ 1 8)
   (+ 0 9)
   9   
   #+end_src

Clearly, the first one has to deffer the application of inc until a
becomes zero whereas in the second procedure all that is needed to
maintain state is value of a and b. The first one is recursive and
second one iterative.
